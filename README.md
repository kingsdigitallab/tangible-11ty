# Tangible programming with Top Codes and 11ty

This is a demo for the Tangible project using [11ty](https://www.11ty.dev/) as a server and the [https://github.com/TIDAL-Lab/TopCodes](Topcodes)
library.

This experiment was a proof of concept for creating simple, printable tangible programming counters, with a view towards an accessible, vision impaired audience.   It was created by Alex Hadwen-Bennett and Elliott Hall.
